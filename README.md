# Competitive-Programming

This is where I will upload solutions to problems I will solve in various ladders, books and competitions in my upcoming years of undergrad. I might not upload all the solutions to the problems I solve, so please note that this repository is not reflective of my competitive programming progress or career. 

It will also contain stuff that I find cool. 
(I'll code up Problem-5's solution soon and re-upload.)
